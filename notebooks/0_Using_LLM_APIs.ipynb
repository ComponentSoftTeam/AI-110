            "So far, we've explored setting security parameters of the container runtime using the securityContext definition as part of the Pod and container specifications. These specifications are created individually per Pod and usually indirectly through higher abstractions such as Deployments, Jobs, and CronJobs. But how can a cluster administrator or a security expert ensure that a collection of Pods follows certain security standards? The answer is in the Kubernetes Pod Security Standards (PSS) and Pod Security Admission (PSA) controller. PSS defines a common understanding and consistent language around security policies, and PSA helps enforce them. This way, the policies are independent of the underlying enforcement mechanism and can be applied through PSS or other third-party tools. These policies are grouped in three security profiles that are cumulative, from highly permissive to highly restrictive, as follows: Privileged This is an unrestricted profile with the widest possible level of permissions. It is purposely left open and offers allow-by-default mechanisms for trusted users and infrastructure workloads. Baseline This profile is for common noncritical application workloads. It has a minimally restrictive policy and provides a balance between ease of adoption and prevention from known privilege escalations. For example, it won't allow privileged containers, certain security capabilities, and even other configurations outside of the securityContext field. Restricted This is the most restrictive profile that follows the latest security-hardening best practices at the expense of adoption. It is meant for security-critical applications, as well as lower-trust users. On top of the Baseline profile, it puts restrictions on the fields we reviewed earlier, such as allowPrivilegeEscalation , runAsNon Root , runAsUser , and other container configurations. PodSecurityPolicy was the legacy security-policy-enforcement mechanism that was replaced with PSA in Kubernetes v1.25. Going forward, you can use a third-party admission plugin or the built-in PSA controller to enforce the security standards for each namespace. The security standards are applied to a Kubernetes namespace using labels that define the standard level as described earlier and one or more actions to take when a potential violation is detected. Following are the actions you can take: Warn The policy violations are allowed with a user-facing warning. Audit The policy violations are allowed with an auditing log entry recorded. Enforce Any policy violations will cause the Pod to be rejected. With these options defined, Example 23-3 creates a namespace that rejects any Pods that don't satisfy the baseline standard, and also generates a warning for Pods that don't meet the restricted standards requirements. Example 23-3. Set security standards for a namespace  \n",

            "{ s } / {} --- Matching Pods/every Pod in the NetworkPolicy's namespace As an alternative for selecting Pods from the cluster, a range of IP addresses can be specified with a field ipBlock . We show IP ranges in Example 24-5 . Another option is to restrict the traffic to specific ports to the selected Pod. We can specify this list with a ports field that contains all allowed ports. Egress Not only can incoming traffic be regulated, but so can any request that a Pod sends in the outgoing direction. Egress rules are configured precisely with the same options as ingress rules. And as with ingress rules, starting with a very restrictive policy is recommended. However, denying all outgoing traffic is not practical. Every Pod needs interaction with Pods from the system namespace for DNS lookups. Also, if we use ingress rules to restrict incoming traffic, we would have to add mirrored egress rules for the source Pods. So let's be pragmatic and allow all egress within the cluster, forbid everything outside the cluster, and let ingress rules define the network boundaries. Example 24-4 shows the definition of such a rule. Example 24-4. Allow all internal egress traffic  \n",

            ", despite what its name implies, Secret resources are not encrypted but are only Base64 encoded. Nevertheless, Kubernetes does its best to restrict access to a Secret's content with the techniques described in \"How Secure Are Secrets?\" on page 190 . However, as soon as Secret resources are stored outside the cluster, they are naked and vulnerable. With the advent of GitOps as a prevalent paradigm for deploying and maintaining server-side applications, this security challenge is even more pressing. Should Secrets be stored on remote Git repositories? If so, then they must not be stored unencrypted. However, when those are committed encrypted in a source code management system like Git, where do they get decrypted on their way into a Kubernetes cluster? Even when credentials are stored encrypted within the cluster, it is not guaranteed that nobody else can access that confidential information. .regulate access to Kubernetes resources with RBAC rules,1 at least one person has access to all data stored in the cluster: your cluster administrator. Y ou might or might not be able to trust the cluster administrator. It all depends on the context in which your application operates. Are you running a Kubernetes cluster in the cloud operated by somebody else? Or is your application deployed on a big company-wide Kubernetes platform, and you need to know who is running this cluster? Different solutions are required depending on these trust boundaries and confidentiality requirements. Secrets are the Kubernetes answer for confidential configuration in-cluster storage. , so let's now have a look at how we can improve various security aspects of Secrets with additional techniques.  \n",
